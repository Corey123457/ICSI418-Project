This is just folders of code not in any specific setup. The link to the full project folder is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z_1BGpUhkBTQt_9TRmNp7o0MAeGqkYMb/view?usp=drive_link

To use it, unzip it and open the project in vscode or pycharm (I used pycharm)
open two terminals, one in the server folder and one in the app-name folder

in the server terminal, enter "node server.js"
in the app-name terminal, enter "npm start"

When testing this on a computer that just downloaded pycharm and this project, it gave an error the first time and then the second time it worked.
